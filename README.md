# Machine, Deep Learing Training

Progress recording for machine and deep learning studying and practicing.

As of July 2021, most of the practices will be using Jupyter Notebook.

What has been learned/knew so far:

Pre:
Installation and building environment of Anaconda and Tensorflow.

Tensorflow is a bit of tricky, considered that it kept using CPU instead of GPU, but got it covered in the end.

Tensorflow & Keras, 21 July 2021

So, Tensorflow and Keras both are popular for using it to perform machine, deep learning.

In these weeks, based on the given demonstration code of Jupyter Notebook, looked up used functions, methods and datasets in the program.

Knew how Neural Networks and Convolution are implemented with tensorflow and keras, and its datasets.

For now, knew, two common basic beginners dataset, MNIST and CIFAR-10, MNIST is a dataset that consists 60,000 28*28 hand written images,

CIFAR-10 is a dataset that also consists 60,000 images, but it's 32*32 and it has classes, 6,000 images per class, hence 10 classes of colourful images.
